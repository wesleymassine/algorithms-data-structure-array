# Algorithms and data structure with array

This repository contains my studies on algorithms and data structure with classic questions, 
problems and challenges that are part of the fundamentals of computer science.

The solutions are implemented in the `Java` programming language using `Arrays and Matrix`.

The questions and details of each solution are commented at the top of each file.
